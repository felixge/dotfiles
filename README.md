# felixge's dotfiles

These are my dotfiles. I don't recommend you to use them as-is, but rather to serve as an inspiration for your own configurations.

```
# initial installation
git clone https://github.com/felixge/dotfiles.git ~/dotfiles

# install/update dotfiles after adding a new file
make
```
